# spring-boot-graphql

There are many advantages of using GraphQL. Some of them are:

  * No Over-fetching and Under-fetching of Data — Subscribe for what you want
    * Client decides what data to receive not the server like REST API
  * Reduces Network Latency & fewer HTTP request
  * Supports Dynamic API Responses
  * Single Endpoint
  * Reducing the concept of Versioning the APIs
  * No more Strict Handshake between developers — De Coupling
