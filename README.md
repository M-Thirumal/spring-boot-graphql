There are many advantages of using GraphQL. Some of them are:

  * No Over-fetching and Under-fetching of Data — Subscribe for what you want
  * Reduces Network Latency
  * Supports Dynamic API Responses
  * Single Endpoint
  * Reducing the concept of Versioning the APIs
  * No more Strict Handshake between developers — De Coupling
